it works like sh*t ... sry :-{

"error telegram" file contains the errors that I could not fix.
Some of them are fatal to the entire telegram bot (of course, I'm talking about connection errors)
... maybe someday ... ill make another bot, but this time on asyncio.
cpp application was lost// there's only exe file...and it works fine.
Because of the" source " of my bot, i have to use a vpn connection to load the pages. This causes some connection errors too.

tbh, ive lost one of my tg accs, thats why token in this bot means nothing
